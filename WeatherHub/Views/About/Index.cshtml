<h1>About the WeatherHub</h1>
<h2>This project has been developed as a way of showing modern software development technologies.</h2>
<h3>The WeatherHub has been built in C# with an MVC structure using .Net Core 2.2 and Visual Studio 2019. Bootstrap has been used to make the web application responsive.</h3>
<h4>Behind the scenes the application is obtaining data using RESTFul requests using the System.Net.Http.HttpClient library and Web Scraping using HTMLAgilityPack.</h4>

<p>Future technologies which I would like to use in this project are as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Redis as a memory cache</li>
    <li>Webpack to bundle resources such as JavaScript and CSS</li>
    <li>Move the backend out in to a dedicated Web API</li>
    <li>Microsoft Cosmos DB - to store user search data</li>
    <li>Consider moving the frontend in to a VueJS application</li>
    <li>Unit/Integration testing with XUnit or nUnit</li>
    <li>Try out the built in .NET Core Dependency Injection or Autofac</li>
    <li>Babel - to compile ES6 Javascript without having to worry about browser compatibility.</li>
    <li>ESLint - to make code consistent and avoid bugs</li>
</ul>

<p>Over time I will start ticking items of this list of technologies I would like to use and potentially add more as I'm always finding tools I'd like to play with!</p>
