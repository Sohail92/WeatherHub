# WeatherHub
Displays weather information through multiple sources using techniques such as Web Scraping and RESTful API connections

Data Suppliers: 
- Google
- OpenWeather 
- AccuWeather 
- more to come..

Technologies/Techniques used:

- .NET Core 2.2
- Bootstrap
- HTMLAgilityPack
- Test Driven Development (TDD)
- Integration Testing


Technologies which I aim to use as this project progresses:

- Try out the built in .NET Core Dependency Injection
- Potentially drop in VueJS or move the frontend in to a VueJS Project.
- REGEX for google implementation
- Caching to limit load (maybe using REDIS?)
- Webpack
- Babel
- ESLint
