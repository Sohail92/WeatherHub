# WeatherHub
Displays weather information through multiple sources using techniques such as Web Scraping and RESTful API connections

Data Suppliers: 
- Google, OpenWeather, AccuWeather & more to come

Technologies/Techniques used:
- .NET Core 2.2
- Bootstrap
- HTMLAgilityPack
- Test Driven Development (TDD)
- Integration Testing
- Using the built in .NET Core Dependency Injection

Technologies which I aim to use as this project progresses:
- Potentially drop in VueJS or move the frontend in to a VueJS Project.
- REGEX for google implementation
- Caching to limit load (maybe using REDIS?)
- Webpack
- Babel
- ESLint
